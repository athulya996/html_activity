			<p>Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/London" class="md-crosslink autoxref">London</a>, England), British computer scientist, generally  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/credited" class="md-dictionary-link eb md-tooltip-open dictionary-open" data-term="credited">credited</a>  as the inventor of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Wide-Web">World Wide Web</a>. In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by Queen <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-II">Elizabeth II</a> of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.</p>
			<p>Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Ferranti-Mark-I">Ferranti Mark I</a>, the first commercial computer. (See <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/ENIAC#ref216048">computer: The first stored-program machines</a>.) After graduating in 1976 from the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, Berners-Lee designed computer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/software">software</a> for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Poole">Poole</a>, Dorset, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/England">England</a>. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/CERN">CERN</a>, the European <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/particle-physics">particle physics</a> laboratory in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Geneva-Switzerland">Geneva</a>.</p>
			<p>While at CERN, Berners-Lee developed a program for himself, called Enquire, that could store information in files that contained connections (“links”) both within and among separate files—a technique that became known as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/hypertext">hypertext</a>. After leaving CERN, Berners-Lee worked for Image Computer Systems Ltd., located in Ferndown, Dorset, where he designed a variety of computer systems. In 1984 he returned to CERN to work on the design of the laboratory’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-network">computer network</a>, developing procedures that allowed <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diverse">diverse</a> computers to communicate with one another and researchers to control remote machines. In 1989 Berners-Lee drew up a proposal for creating a global hypertext document system that would make use of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet">Internet</a>. His goal was to provide researchers with the ability to share their results, techniques, and practices without having to exchange <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/e-mail">e-mail</a> constantly. Instead, researchers would place such information “online,” where their peers could immediately retrieve it anytime, day or night. Berners-Lee wrote the software for the first Web server (the central repository for the files to be shared) and the first Web client, or “browser” (the program to access and display files retrieved from the server), between October 1990 and the summer of 1991. The first “killer application” of the Web at CERN was the laboratory’s telephone directory—a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mundane">mundane</a> beginning for one of the technological wonders of the computer age.</p>
			<p>From 1991 to 1993 Berners-Lee evangelized the Web. In 1994 in the United States he established the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Wide-Web-Consortium">World Wide Web (W3)</a> Consortium at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s</a> Laboratory for Computer Science. The consortium, in consultation with others, lends oversight to the Web and the development of standards. In 1999 Berners-Lee became the first holder of the 3Com Founders chair at the Laboratory for Computer Science. His numerous other honours included the National Academy of Engineering’s prestigious <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Draper-Prize">Charles Stark Draper Prize</a> (2007). Berners-Lee was the author, along with Mark Fischetti, of Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web (2000).</p>
